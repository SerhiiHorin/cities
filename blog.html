      <h1>How smart cities can engage citizens and bridge the Digital Divide</h1>

        <p>Smart or not, cities have always relied on their people to drive change.</p>
        <p>Elected officials, after all, cannot act alone. They need an engaged, educated and supportive citizenry to bring new ideas to life.</p>
        <p>So when forward-looking Smart City officials implement new tools and technologies with the goal of easing everyday obstacles, solving the logistics of city travel and building communication between residents and government – it’s the citizenry that determines their success.</p>
        <p>Potential users of the technology must decide whether to adopt these tools by <strong>weighing the benefit of the experience against the investment</strong>.</p>
        <p>Take the example of an app that monitors parking inventory:</p>
        <p>Running late to a show, a user has to find a parking space in peak hours. Instead of maneuvering through rows of traffic in search of an available space, she simply pulls out her smartphone and check a map detailing available spots.</p>
        <p>Turning into the parking spot, the car hits a large pothole. Being a loyal citizen, she takes a picture of the pothole and sends the image with a GPS tag to the city transportation department, where staff can document the problem and schedule a fix.</p>
        <p>In this scenario, the benefit for the user – and the city – seems strong. An app that provides this type of experience has potential to be widely adopted.</p>
        <p>But what happens to those citizens who don’t have the ability to participate in the technology due to something called the <strong>Digital Divide</strong>?</p>
        <p>It’s amazing that, in 2016, many people in the world still don’t have access to mobile devices and the Internet. But <a target="_blank" href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2015.pdf">research</a> shows the divide is real:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>43% of people in the world have Internet access. That means 57% do not.</li>
        <li>46% of people worldwide have mobile broadband access. Again, that means the majority of people in the world do not have access to mobile devices.</li>
      </ul>
        <p>The penetration is wider in wealthier, more developed nations (77% of Europeans use the Internet, for instance) – and with wealthier, more educated people (90% of Americans with a college degree have Internet access). That means a city’s most vulnerable populations – its elderly, minorities and poor – are most likely to be left out.</p>
        <p>This divide should be a concern of officials who wish to fully involve their citizens in Smart City growth. Regardless of the technologies a city <em>can</em> provide, if residents can’t access or use them effectively, the programs won’t be successful. The answer may be as simple as providing publicly accessible devices or launching a series of educational seminars for residents. Perhaps it starts in the public education system with IT lessons for the next generation. Regardless of the approach, the divide must be addressed.</p>
        <p>Yes, digital, mobile technologies can arm people with instantaneous information that helps them make smarter, faster decisions.</p>
        <p>But technology is only an enabler. It’s a city’s people that drive the change.</p>
      <h1>Smart cities need smart citizens – and that starts with education</h1>
        <p>As we start to <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.csc.com/2016/09/22/for-smart-cities-the-future-is-now/">catch glimpses of the city of tomorrow</a> – one brought to life by the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile applications, ubiquitous connectivity and other digital technologies – it’s becoming clear that the <strong>citizens of tomorrow</strong> will also need to adapt.</p>
        <p><strong>Smart cities need smart citizens to thrive</strong> – and in a digital world, that means a populace with access to – and familiarity with – the technologies that drive much of daily life today.</p>
        <p>It’s not enough for smart city leaders to assume this type of education is taking place. They should play an active role in <strong>making IT part of the very fabric of public education</strong>, in schools and beyond.</p>
        <p>The idea is starting to take hold in countries around Europe and the world.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/innovation/ireland-wants-best-education-system-europe-2026">Irish government</a> recently revealed plans to bring coding classes to primary schools and computer science to graduation requirements. “It is central to sustaining economic success and in converting economic success into building a strong community,” aptly said Ireland’s Education Minister Richard Bruton.</li>
        <li>A neat program in Hungarian schools is bringing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.3ders.org/articles/20160607-every-hungarian-school-to-get-3d-printer-within-three-years-through-3dtech-program.html">3-D printers to the classroom</a> with the goal of training kids in modeling and other skills that have applications in the workforce.</li>
        <li>In Israel, the UK and now some Japanese cities, students as young as 5 are required to take computer programming classes to help them think logically and creatively and prepare for a future that will depend even more on technology.</li>
      </ul>
        <p>As Andreas Schleicher, a director of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development told <a href="http://www.thememo.com/2016/04/04/edtech-oecd-andreas-schleicher-education-technology-summit/">The Memo earlier this year</a>, “Students unable to navigate through a complex digital landscape will no longer be able to participate fully in the economic, social and cultural life around them.”</p>
        <p>And that includes the benefits of a smart city.</p>
        <p>The Nordic region definitely seems to grasp what’s at stake. A <a target="_blank" href="http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:934717/FULLTEXT01.pdf">report released this summer</a> proposes expanding mandatory education and training to adults to meet the challenges posed by “globalization, digitalization and technological advances.”</p>
        <p>“The combination of rapid technological changes and a progressively higher retirement age further increases the need for something new in the education area… The challenge is not to work harder, but to work smarter,” it reads.</p>
        <p>This type of adult IT education seems an ideal project for smart cities to champion. The digital divide is real and it can hold back, not only affected individuals, but the city as a whole.</p>
        <p>Schools, educators and students – whatever the age – have much to gain from smart city investments. An open digital infrastructure, paired with access to tools that increase collaboration and engagement, improve the educational experience, better preparing students for a job in the knowledge economy of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
